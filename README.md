# Hello-World
Just another respitory

My NickName is Tav, I am a beginner Developer, managing 90+ WP ecommerse sites using the aliplugin!  I'd like to learn much more on coding and to develop my own wordpress plugins and modify some plugins so that they work better for my sites.  This new website project takes up about 16 hours a day 6 days a week.  

I'd like to build a chatbot with capabilities of chating on 20+ social networks as well as liking pages and requesting likes for my pages, adding friends, posting messages, and much more.

Cheers Everyone
I wish to talk to people and learn very much
